# robotDevastation-research

[Robot Devastation](http://asrob-uc3m.github.io/workgroups/2017-05-28-robot-devastation.html) research repository.

Experiments that could be later added to robotDevastation. Some of them may be suitable for beginners that want to start developing on robotDevastation :wink:

Originated from https://github.com/asrob-uc3m/robotDevastation/issues/31, where the following lines were proposed:

* Add support more cool robots to RobotDevastation:
    * https://github.com/bqlabs/loki
    * https://github.com/bqlabs/mizu
    * [Ganker Robot - Omnidirectional robot with swords](http://gjs.so/en/)
* Add AR interfaces:
